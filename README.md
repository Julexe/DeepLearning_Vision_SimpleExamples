# Various Simple Examples of Deep Learning / Vision

Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras
Vision with DLib


## Classifier
classifier.py: classify 2D points (x,y). Points upper than sin(x) are from class 1 (y>sin(x)), points lower than sin(x) are from class 2 (y<sin(x)).
=> tensorflow and keras

## GAN
gan.py: GAN learn to generate 2D points (x,y) positionned above sin(x). => does not work yet !

## DLib
dlib_facial_landmarks.py
dlib_video_facial_landmarks.py
=> test of DLib to get landmarks on faces from photos and video
